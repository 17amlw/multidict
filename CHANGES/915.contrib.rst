The test framework has been refactored. In the previous state, the circular
imports reported in :issue:`837` caused the C-extension tests to be skipped.

Now, there is a set of the ``pytest`` fixtures that is set up in a parametrized
manner allowing to have a consistent way of accessing mirrored ``multidict``
implementations across all the tests.

This change also implemented a pair of CLI flags (``--c-extensions`` /
``--no-c-extensions``) that allow to explicitly request deselecting the tests
running against the C-extension.
